The ContractType information in combination with a given state of the risk factors will produce a deterministic sequence of cash flows which are the basis of any financial analysis.

    # Contract Role :: CNTRL defines which position the CRID ( the creator of the contract record ) takes in a contract. For example, whether the contract is an asset or liability, a long or short position for the CRID. Most contracts are simple on or off balance sheet positions which are assets, liabilities. Such contracts can also play a secondary role as a collateral. The attribute is highly significant since it determines the direction of all cash flows. The exact meaning is given with each CT in the ACTUS High Level Specification document.

The counterparty of the contract is tracked in CPID.CRID is ideally the official LEI which can be a firm, a government body, even a single person etc. However, this can also refer to a annonymous group in which case this information is not to be disclosed.
