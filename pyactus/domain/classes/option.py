    # Calendar :: Calendar defines the non-working days which affect the dates of contract events (CDE's) in combination with EOMC and BDC. Custom calendars can be added as additional enum options.
    calendar : enums.Calendar
    
    # Business Day Convention :: BDC's are linked to a calendar. Calendars have working and non-working days. A BDC value other than N means that cash flows cannot fall on non-working days, they must be shifted to the next business day (following) or the previous on (preceding).These two simple rules get refined twofold:- Following modified (preceding): Same like following (preceding), however if a cash flow gets shifted into a new month, then  it is shifted to preceding (following) business day.- Shift/calculate (SC) and calculate/shift (CS). Accrual, principal, and possibly other calculations are affected by this choice. In the case of SC first the dates are shifted and after the shift cash flows are calculated. In the case of CS it is the other way round.Attention: Does not affect non-cyclical dates such as PRD, MD, TD, IPCED since they can be set to the correct date directly.

    # End Of Month Convention :: When computing schedules a special problem arises if an anchor date is at the end of a month and a cycle of monthly or quarterly is applied (yearly in the case of leap years only). How do we have to interpret an anchor date April 30 plus 1M cycles? In case where EOM is selected, it will jump to the 31st of May, then June 30, July 31 and so on. If SM is selected, it will jump to the 30st always with of course an exception in February. This logic applies for all months having 30 or less days and an anchor date at the last day. Month with 31 days will at any rate jump to the last of the month if anchor date is on the last day.

    # Contract Type :: The ContractType is the most important information. It defines the cash flow generating pattern of a contract. The ContractType information in combination with a given state of the risk factors will produce a deterministic sequence of cash flows which are the basis of any financial analysis.

    # Contract Role :: CNTRL defines which position the CRID ( the creator of the contract record ) takes in a contract. For example, whether the contract is an asset or liability, a long or short position for the CRID. Most contracts are simple on or off balance sheet positions which are assets, liabilities. Such contracts can also play a secondary role as a collateral. The attribute is highly significant since it determines the direction of all cash flows. The exact meaning is given with each CT in the ACTUS High Level Specification document.

    # Creator Identifier :: This identifies the legal entity creating the contract record. The counterparty of the contract is tracked in CPID.CRID is ideally the official LEI which can be a firm, a government body, even a single person etc. However, this can also refer to a annonymous group in which case this information is not to be disclosed. CRID may also refer to a group taking a joint risk.

CPID may also refer to a group taking a joint risk or more generally, CPID is the main counterparty, against which the contract has been settled.

    # Maturity Date :: Marks the contractual end of the lifecycle of a CT. Generally, date of the last cash flows. This includes normally a principal and an interest payment. Some Maturity CTs as perpetuals (PBN) do not have such a date. For variable amortizing contracts of the ANN CT, this date might be less than the scheduled end of the contract (which is deduced from the periodic payment amount PRNXT). In this case it balloons.

    # Purchase Date :: If a contract is bought after initiation (for example a bond on the secondary market) this date has to be set. It refers to the date at which the payment (of PPRD) and transfer of the security happens. In other words, PRD - if set - takes the role otherwise IED has from a cash flow perspective. Note, CPID of the CT is not the counterparty of the transaction!

Whether it is a call/put is determined by the attribute OPTP, i.e a call or a put (or a combination of call/put).This attribute is used for price related options such as options on bonds, stocks or FX. Interest rate related options (caps/floos) are handled within th RatReset group.
